List of features
----------------
+ Graph-based data model that enables:

  - to represent complex data formats and also to mix them
  - complex data manipulations
  - to dissect/absorb existing data
  - generation & mutation fuzzing strategy

+ Fuzzing automation framework:

  - target abstraction
  - monitoring means based on independant probes
  - replay & logging
  - data manipulation based on disruptors (objects that implement
    specific data transformation)
  - scenario infrastructure (for modeling protocol logic)
  - virtual operators

+ and so on...

What's still missing
--------------------
+ Refer to TODO file

About documentation
-------------------
+ Documentation is available `here`_.
+ In order to generate the documentation from the source, follow these steps:

  #. go to the folder ``docs/``
  #. execute ``make html`` to generate HTML documentation
  #. execute ``make latexpdf`` to generate PDF documentation
  #. generated documentation is located in ``docs/build/``

Launch fuddly test cases
------------------------

The package ``test`` include all unit & integration test cases
of ``fuddly`` itself. From the ``src/`` directory, usage is as follows:

- To launch all the tests, issue the command::

    >> python -m fuddly.test -a

- To launch all the tests but the longer ones, issue the command::

    >> python -m fuddly.test

- To avoid data model specific test cases use the option ``--ignore-dm-specifics``

- To launch a specific test category issue the following command::

    >> python -m fuddly.test fuddly.test.<test_package>.<test_module>.<Test_Class>.<test_method>


Miscellaneous
-------------
+ Don't forget to populate ``<fuddly data folder>/imported_data/`` with sample files for data
  models that need it

+ Note that when the fuddly shell is launched, the path of the fuddly data folder is displayed as
  well as its configuration folder

Dependencies
------------
+ Compatible with Python3
+ Mandatory:

  - `sqlite3`_: SQLite3 data base

+ Optional:

  - `xtermcolor`_: Terminal color support
  - `graphviz`_: For graphic visualization (e.g., scenario display)
  - `paramiko`_: Python implementation of the SSHv2 protocol
  - `serial`_: For serial port access
  - `cups`_: Python bindings for libcups
  - `rpyc`_: Remote Python Call (RPyC), a transparent and symmetric RPC library
  - `pyxdg`_: XDG Base Directory support

+ For testing:

  - `ddt`_: Used for data-driven tests
  - `mock`_: Used for mocking

+ For documentation generation:

  - `sphinx`_: sphinx >= 1.3 (with builtin napoleon extension)
  - `texlive`_ (optional): Needed to generate PDF documentation
  - `readthedocs theme`_ (optional): Privileged html theme for sphinx
